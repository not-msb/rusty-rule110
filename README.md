# rusty-rule110

Rule 110 implemented in Rust  
One of my very first algorithms I implemented, it was a lot of fun making this.
The best part is that I completely wrote this on my phone in termux :D

Usage: `make clean debug/release [video]`

You can change the W/H constants in `src/main.rs` to change the width and height of the output video.
The default 200x200 might take some time to render, so lowering it is encouraged if you'd like to see what it looks like.
